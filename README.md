### **CHALLENGE ACCEPTED**


First, I have to say this. This is the first time I’ve been with a group of the brightest individuals in tech, and with the same purpose as me, without feeling like its a competition. Everyone here wants everyone else to succeed.
The atmosphere is awesome. Since most Bootcampers come from a self-learning background, it’s amazing to know how far they’ve got on their own and in very little time. I heard stories of their experiences, the obstacles they faced and how they stumped it. Every day was about learning new things and getting help where I faced issues. The adaptation was a bit lighter with these amazing individuals.
