#  1. MY BOOTCAMP JOUNERY

I had in mind that UT BOOTCAMP will be one of the toughest days in my developer journey yet, i wasn't disppointed.

### **CHALLENGE ACCEPTED**


First of all, I would like to say, this is the first time that I’ve been with such a bright group of individuals that have an interest in tech with the same purpose as myself, without feeling like its a competition. Everyone here wants everyone else to succeed!
The atmosphere is awesome. Most Bootcampers come from a self-learning background, and it’s amazing to see how far they’ve gotten on their own and in such very little time. I hear stories of their experiences, the obstacles they have faced and how they have overcome them dispite their level of expertise. Every day is about learning new things and getting help where I encounter issues. The adaptation is a bit lighter with these amazing individuals.
